# 🐟 Smart Sardine Drying System (IoT + Flutter App)

An IoT-powered system for **accelerating sardine drying** using controlled heat and airflow.  
Built around the **ESP32**, this project combines **sensors, actuators, and a mobile app** for real-time monitoring, threshold control, and remote operation.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- Automatic drying control with **heater + fan**
- **Temperature & humidity monitoring** (DHT sensor)
- **Weight tracking** for drying progress (Load cell + HX711)
- **Battery-powered system** with solar support
- Local + remote monitoring:
  - **BLE/Wi-Fi** direct control
  - Optional **cloud / SMS alerts**
- **Flutter mobile app**:
  - Dashboard for sensor values & system state
  - Remote ON/OFF & threshold updates
  - Notifications for drying complete, low battery, errors
